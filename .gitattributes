# Windows script files should be CR+LF always:
*.bat text eol=crlf

# Unix/Linux script files should be LF always:
*.sh text eol=lf

# Some files are binary always:
*.png bin
*.ico bin

# The rest are assumed text sources with platform-dependent EOL being okay,
# **.groovy, *.kts, *.conf*, *.gdsl...) or we let Git guess otherwise:
* text=auto
